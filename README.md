# Youtube Downloader
Ever thought that the only way to download stuff was the sketchy way? Nobody likes trackers in their browser. I also like to download yt videos for stuff.

good uses:
- watching videos offline
- downloading music videos to use in videos
- downloading music to listen to offline
- take a clip from another person's videos (with their permission)

bad uses:
- stealing content
- modifying content and framing the creator of the original content
- claiming content to be your own

Please be respectful of what you do with this.
